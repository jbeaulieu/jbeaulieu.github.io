									<h3 class="major">Motivation</h3>
									<p>Do I really need to outline the motivation for this project? Retro games are timeless classics and often possess a level of charm and nostalgia not found in modern creations.
									Playing these games on a PC can be difficult though, as you'll typically need a different emulation program installed for each console you wish to emulate, not to mention
									the fact that playing on a keyboard is never the same as having a good-old-fashioner controller in your hands.</p>

									<p><span class="image right" style="text-align:center"><img src="images/retrocube/cube_000.jpg" alt="" /><sup>Say goodbye, Mario</sup></span>
									A Raspberry Pi is the perfect device to consolidate your digital collection of retro games*. In fact, there is a version of it's OS readily available	for just this purpose -
									<a href="https://retropie.org.uk/" target="_blank">RetroPie</a>. It features support for a wide variety of retro systems, as well as various usb game controllers.
									I've always been a fan of the GameCube, and the system seemed like it would offer adequate internal space once the original guts were cleared out. With this in mind, I dove in
									with the goal of having a fully functional GameCube housing filled with retro gaming internals.<br>
									<sub>* Note: It is your job to acquire & use digital copies of your games	in a legal manner. I take no responsibility for consequences stemming from your use of pirated games
									or other software.</sub></p><br>

									<h3 class="major">Parts required</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>Nintendo GameCube - preferably a broken one; if it's still working, let it live!</li>
										<li>Raspberry Pi - A <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/" target="_blank">Pi 3</a> will get you the best performance and make the software setup much easier</li>
										<li>Wii U GameCube USB adapter - I used an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/wiiu/accessories" target="_blank">official Nintendo adapter</a>, but <a href="http://www.mayflash.com/products/nintendowiiu/w012.html" target="_blank">third-party</a> ones will also work</li>
										<li>MicroUSB power supply - I recommend one that supplies at least 1.5A, to make sure it can support the peripherals</li>
										<li>Small tool set, particularly a small hex socket and phillips heads</li>
										<li>Soldering kit - Iron, solder, flux, wire, etc.</li>
									</ul>

									<h3 class="major">Teardown</h3>
									<p>First things first, we'll need to open up the GameCube and remove it's internal bits.</p>

									<p style="overflow:hidden; vertical-align:center"><span class="image right" style="text-align:center"><img src="images/retrocube\cube_001.jpg" alt="" /><sup>Fig. 1: Top housing removed</sup></span>
									Step one is to separate the top and bottom outer housings, by removing the four screws on the GC's underside, one in each corner. Getting these screws out was
									one of the hardest parts of the disassembly, as Nintendo was kind enough to use its proprietary screwheads. I found a small hex socket offered enough purchase to
									undo them. You may need to get more creative depending on the tools at your disposal.</p>

									<p style="overflow:hidden"><span class="image left" style="text-align:center"><img src="images/retrocube\cube_002.jpg" alt="" /><sup>Fig. 2: Disc drive & rear panel removed</sup></span>
									Next, we need to remove the disc drive and the rear part of the outer housing. This is relatively easy, all you need to do is take out several screws around the perimeter of the base.
									Then pull the disc assembly straight up to remove it, as there are vertical connectors between it and the motherboard below.</p>
