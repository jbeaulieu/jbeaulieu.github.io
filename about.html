								<h2>Welcome!</h2>
								<p>Hi, I'm Jon! I'm a software developer with interests in everything from
									roadtrips to hobby electronics. I've set up shop in this corner of the
									internet to showcase some of my background, and to have a central hub for
									all of my projects and professional connections. Have a look around, and
									get inspired!</p>

								<h2>My Work</h2>
								<p>Professionally, my focus is within the realms of mobile devlopment and web
									applications. I enjoy making accessible software that can be used by anyone,
									whether it directly improves their quality-of-life or simply provides an
									element of convenience. I have an eye for user-centered design, and I'm just
									as comfortable meeting with end users as I am coding server backends.</p>

								<h2>My Passions</h2>
								<p>Outside of work, my interests include music, DIY electronics projects, and
									experiencing the outdoors. I use these hobbies as a way to relax and channel
									my creativity. I play the piano, bike to work, and go for long trail runs to
									clear my head and stay in shape.</p>

								<h2>My Projects</h2>
								<p>I'm a believer in the open-source software movement, and I think code is at
									its best when it is able to be viewed, shared, and improved by everyone. To
									that end, the majority of my software projects are provided under the
									<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>, giving you free
									reign to use or change them as you see fit - please just remember to attribute
									me as the original creator, so that others can find my work as well!</p>
								<p>I'm currently in the process of moving my existing projects to this site and
									Github to provide better accessibility. Please check back later to see more
									great stuff!</p>
