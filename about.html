								<h3 class="major">Welcome!</h3>
								<p>Hi, I'm Jon! I'm a software developer with interests in everything from roadtrips to hobby electronics. I've set up shop in this corner of the internet to showcase
									some of my background, and to have a central hub for all of my projects and professional connections. Have a look around, and get inspired!</p>

								<h3 class="major">My Work</h3>
								<p>Professionally, my focus is within the realms of mobile devlopment and web applications. I enjoy making accessible software that can be used by anyone, whether it directly
									improves their quality-of-life or simply provides an element of convenience. I have an eye for user-centered design, and I'm just as comfortable meeting with end users as I
									am coding server backends.</p>

								<h3 class="major">My Passions</h3>
								<p>Outside of work, my interests include music, DIY electronics projects, and experiencing the outdoors in any way I can. I use these hobbies as a way to relax and channel my
									creativity. I play the piano, bike to work, and go for long trail runs to clear my head or </p>

								<p>Listening to and playing music has always been a source of enjoyment for me. I learned to play the piano at a young age, and still keep a keyboard at home that I can

								<blockquote>I’m not inclined to make grand pronouncements about the future of software, but if anything kills off commercial software, let me tell you, it won’t be open source
									software. They needn’t bother. Commercial software will gleefully strangle itself to death on its own licensing terms.<br>-Jeff Atwood</blockquote>

								<p>I am a staunch believer in the principles of open-source software. I believe that the core purpose of software is to improve the lives of its users, and that those improvements
									are best implemented when people are free to collaborate or work off of each other's ideas. To that end, the majority of my software projects are provided under the
									<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>, giving you free reign to use or change them as you see fit - please just remember to attribute me as the original
									creator, so that others can find my work as well!</p>

								<p>Head over to my <a href="#">Projects</a> page to see a list of my past creations and some of the stuff I'm working on right now, or check out my
									<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=J.B.+Productions">Google Play listing</a> to view and download my published Android apps. You'll never see ads or unnecessary
									permissions built	into any of my mobile apps - I take pride in the fact that my projects are provided out of a desire to help and inspire other creators like me,
									rather than to make some ad-based revenue.</p>
